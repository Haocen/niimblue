# NiimBlue

Niimbot printers webui. Design and print labels right from your browser.

Bluetooth connection works fine, serial needs some work.

There is no code yet. It will be pushed when I finish a library and ui. It is very raw.

If you really want to see how it made, you can browse source code [here](https://gitee.mmote.ru/MultiMote/niimblue-nightly) (you will see auto-generated daily commits, after first release repository will be deleted).

Tested printers:

- Niimbot D110
- Niimbot B1

## Demo

The public preview is available here: https://dev.mmote.ru/niimblue/ (updated often).
